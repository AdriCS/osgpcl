OpenSceneGraph Point Cloud Library

This is a repository of PCL visualization tools implemented using 
the OpenSceneGraph Library.  

The cloud viewer application can view in core and out of core points.

Depedencies:

PCL
http://www.pointclouds.org/

OpenSceneGraph
http://www.openscenegraph.org/


Usage:

To force color rendering (needed for out of core viewing) use 
cloud_viewer -C 

You can find a large example point cloud to try at:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/djiey6b4jnc5dv0/chappes.pcd

To view the full point cloud in color, simply use 

cloud_viewer -C chappes.pcd

You can generate an out of core point cloud from this large point cloud
via 

pcl_outofcore_process -gen_lod chappes.pcd chappes_tree

Then use "cloud_viewer -C chappes_tree/tree.oct_idx" to view in color.
